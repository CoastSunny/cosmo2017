# CoSMo Day 8
* The stuff from this day is *supremely* important to the T5 project.
## Sections in the talk by *Reza Shadmehr* today
* *1.* Separations of move circuits from hold circuits
* *2.* Movement vis internal Feedback
* *3.* Neural basis of adaptation (in the cerebellum)

## *1.* Separate neural systems for moving and holding still

### Questions
* How are "Hopfield Networks" used for memory? - refer for use in T5 system
* Look at the link between the (evolutionarily speaking - ie. phylogenetically older) old rostral M1's arc to the spinal interneurons and the new caudal M1's arc directly to the motoneuron in the production of voluntary movement.
* Robert Sainburg - hemispherical control - ask Eugene Poh for more info.
  * Dynamic Dominance Theory - different hemispheres control different parts of movement.

## *2.* Movement via internal feedback
* Vigor to movement based on what you like better (chocolate vs. apple on either side) controlled by (presumably) the cerebellum.

### Questions
* What's a purkinje cell?
* What is the effect of lidocaine?

## *3.* Neural basis of adaptation
* Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi (1994)
* Scott? and Shadmehr (2016) has some proof about the delays of the transcortical reflex pathway
* Shadmehr, Brandt, Corkin (1998), Smith and Shadmehr (2005)
* Hertzfeld et. al. (2014) Science
  * Washout does not mean you're erasing. It actually means we are relearning something new, in the opposite sense. This is why washout also helps in learning even if the next learning trial is in the opposite direction. This is, I think, because learning sets a new baseline and when washout is done, learning happens on a different net since you're resetting the network in the opposite direction during washout. Finally, when the second learning trial tests the opposite direction to the first one, error is in the same direction as the washout - so, we are using previously learned info from the washout.
* Paul - Credit assignment is the process of back-propagating errors in a complex system where there are many locations where noise may be injected.

### Questions
* What are error-clamped trials?
* Entre - receptive fields again - what are they?
* Inferior olives, superiros colliculi and purkinje cells - lots of neurophysiology terms to go over again.
* The olive cell - p-cell system acts like a more complex version of the stretch reflex, but use visual cues rather than proprioceptive system.
