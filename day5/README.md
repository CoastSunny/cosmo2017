# CoSMo 2017 - Day 5

## Could a Neuroscientist understand a Microprocessor - Konrad
The importance of this question relates to the techniques that Neuroscientists use. The paper of the same title explores this by applying neural analysis techniques on a Microprocessor.

### My questions from this talk
* What is GLM - how does it relate to a PCA?

## GLM - Konrad tutorial
Refer notes for more.

### Questions
* Likelihood vs aposterior vs apriori?

## Model Fitting - Luigi Acerbi tutorial
Creating better optimizers than 'fminsearch.'

The 'Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS) optimization algorithm' wiki has information on how to perform good model fitting.

### Questions
* When is a conditional probability a Likelihood and when is it a posterior.
* how to create inline functions/handles on MATLAB?
* What are Hessian and inverse Hessian?
* What are Approximate Hessian (DFP) and inverse Hessian (BFGS)?
* Investigate Acerbi and Ma 2017, arXiv Preprint?
* Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)?
* Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)?
 * Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC)?
 * How to perform and understand Cross Validation (VC)? - look at previous lecture by Konrad Kording
 * What the heck is Marginal Likelihood?
 * Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?
