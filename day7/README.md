# CoSMo Day 7

## Link between decision making and motor control - Alaa Ahmed
### Possible research for BBDL
* Look in the notes for a possibility of answering the results they produced using forces rather than inertia or perhaps both.

## Reaction time and neural preludes to movement - Reza Shadmehr

### Questions
* What is the role of the superior colliculus
* Look at the neural activity in Sparks 1978
* When fixation related neurons artificially stimulated, do the movement related neuron still fire or is there mutual inhibition?
* colliculi have receptive fields - what is the receptive field?
* What is MEG?
