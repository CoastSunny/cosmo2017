# CoSMo Day 9
* This day's speaker is *Dagmar Sternad*

## *1.* Understanding Motor Disorders: A Task-Dynamic Approach
* Collins and Ruina (2004) has an interesting passive dynamic walker - how are they producing the repeated locomotion when there is NO controller or motor?
* Definitions need to be precise - don't use words like 'often' or the 'either X or Y.'

*   #### Dagmar's Task-Dynamic Approach
  1. Choose a task with interesting features.
  2. create a math model of the task.
  3. derive the space of solutions
  4. ... (finish)

* In the TNC performance curves that Dagmar shows, there is an obvious exponential (or hyperbolic) roll-off in learning rate/performance improvement.

### Questions
1. She says there is redundancy - has she considered the over-determined nature of the arm?
2. What is the TNC analysis?
3. It seems easier to perform the task to the left where in fact there is greater variance.
  * This is because they consider the task biomechanics only - but if signal dependent noise is considered things change.
  * SIDE NOTE: She was able to detect the question and immediately gave an answer - it is a result of knowing the assumptions of the task very well - this goes back to "CoSMo: How to Model" tenets where we explicitly state all of our assumptions very well.
